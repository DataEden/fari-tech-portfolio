**Project 1: SOX Control Testing Automation with Python**

**Overview:**  
This project simulates a typical SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) IT General Controls (ITGC) testing task using Python. It demonstrates the use of Python to read, parse, and validate control evidence data across multiple CSV logs.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Python (pandas, os)  
- Control evaluation logic  
- Automation scripting for control evidence checks  
- Clean, commented code and audit-read documentation  

**Folder Structure:**  
```
üìÅ sox-control-checker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ control_checker.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system1.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system2.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

**How It Works:**  
- Parses all CSV logs in the `sample_logs/` directory  
- Flags users marked as `terminated` who still have `access_granted = True`  
- Outputs a summary in the console and a CSV report of all violations  

**How to Run:**  
1. Clone the repo or copy files locally  
2. Install dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file  
3. Run the script `control_checker.py`  
4. Review the generated `violations_report.csv` for flagged entries  

**Why This Matters:**  
This kind of automation saves time during quarterly SOX testing cycles, improves accuracy, and demonstrates how auditors can apply scripting skills to streamline review tasks.

**Project 2: Power BI + Python Audit Dashboard**

**Overview:**  
This project combines a Python ETL script with a Power BI dashboard that visualizes system access trends, audit issues by severity, and remediation statuses.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Data transformation using Python (pandas)  
- Dashboard design in Power BI  
- Visual storytelling and metric reporting (KRI/KPI)  
- Audit-focused visuals: open vs. closed issues, SOX vs. operational issues, aging buckets  

**Files:**  
- `audit_etl.py`: Reads and cleans audit logs or issue tracker CSVs, outputs summarized data for Power BI  
- `dashboard.pbix`: Power BI file showing interactive audit visuals  
- `README.md`: Describes how the data flows from raw logs to visual insights  

**Outcome:**  
Demonstrates how modern auditors can use visualization and automation to track progress, prioritize risks, and report findings to executives with clarity.
